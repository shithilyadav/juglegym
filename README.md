<h1> Project Title : </h1>
 gym website 

<br />
<h1>Problem Statement : </h1> 
Lack of information:  Many people don't know where to start when it comes to fitness. A gym website can provide educational resources, such as workout routines, healthy recipes, and articles on different fitness topics.

Ineffective workout routines: People who don't have a good understanding of fitness may create workout routines that are not effective for their goals. A gym website can offer personalized workout plans or guidance on how to create a safe and effective workout routine.

Difficulty tracking progress: It can be difficult to stay motivated if you don't see results. A gym website can offer fitness trackers that allow people to track their workouts, weight loss, and other fitness goals.

Decreased motivation: Working out can be tough, and it's easy to get discouraged. A gym website can provide motivational content, such as success stories from other members, to help people stay on track.
